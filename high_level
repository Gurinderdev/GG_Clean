Goals

1) Unsupervised data match 
2) Match of names not addresses
3) Give the user multiple options in terms of what one would find - that is multiple options to use for cleaning a list of names
4) Primary source of error - typing errors  

To do on high level

What source of error are we trying to fight 	Typing in error 
How are we takling the error	Build a probability model of error
	        1) Based on probablity of error with key in center and how the other keys are likely to be hit
	        2)  do some EDA on how the errors are generated in the first place
	        3) Consider word2vec
	        4) Consider building in different distance measures 
	        
Final model for unsupervised - what we would nead
1) How many files would be need
	2) What models would be used 
	3) How would the output be created
